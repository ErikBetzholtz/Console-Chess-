# Console-Chess-
This project means to create a local implementation of chess where two players can take turns moving pieces until someone wins. The greatest challenges will be for us to code the game in such a way that the game prevents wrongful moves and hopefully to sense when a player is in a position where no moves can be made, resulting in a loss.
